# This module mimics a NameNode in Hadoop which manages the namespace of the file system
# This could act as a central registry for shards, handling the logic for determining
# which shard to write to or read from.

# Placeholder for sharding logic
def get_shard_for_reading():
    # Implement your logic here to choose the appropriate shard for reading
    pass


def get_shard_for_writing():
    # Implement your logic here to choose the appropriate shard for writing
    pass


def get_shard_location(shard_keys):
    # Logic to determine which shard contains the data for the given shard keys
    # This information would be typically stored in a configuration file or a database
    # For example, it could return a dictionary of shard names to their URI
    return {
        "shard1": "mongodb://shard1-uri",
        "shard2": "mongodb://shard2-uri",
        # ...
    }

# Add additional logic for tracking replicas and their status
